\section*{Course information}

\begin{outline}

\1 {\bfseries Description:} Via the course catalog:
\begin{quote}
{\bfseries 202 Introduction to Statistics }

Data collection, summarization, correlation, regression, probability,
sampling, estimation, tests of significance. Does not require calculus
and makes minimal use of mathematics.
\end{quote}

\1 {\bfseries Objective:} Via the syllabi of past instructors: 
\begin{quote}
To help you develop a critical attitude toward statistical
arguments. This course is for people who want to be able to comprehend
and use statistics better in their work. This course stands by itself
and also serves as a background for further statistics courses,
helping to provide the intuition which can sometimes be lost amid the
formulas. 
\end{quote}

\1 {\bfseries Prerequisites:} High school algebra

\1 {\bfseries Website:} \url{https://courses.northwestern.edu}

\1 {\bfseries Required Textbook:} {\em Probability and Statistics} by
the Open Learning Initiative (OLI) of Carnegie Mellon University. 

   \2 The OLI textbook is online only. It is accessed via our course
   BlackBoard site ( \url{https://courses.northwestern.edu} ) under
   the Assignments section. 

   \2 The textbook is purchased directly from OLI upon first access
   (\$25). 

\1 {\bfseries Course Format:} This course uses a hybrid of traditional
lecture based and online instructional strategies. 

   \2 {\bfseries Lecture:} MWF from 10-10:50 AM in Annenberg Hall
   G15. Lecture serves to (i) introduce new material, and (ii) address
   common student questions. Attendance is mandatory. (3 hours / week) 

   \2 {\bfseries Reading and ``Did I get this?'':} The OLI readings
   expand on the material presented in lecture and offer
   opportunities for checking your understanding with {\em ungraded}
   ``Did I get this?'' activities. ( approx. 4 hours / week ) 

   \2 {\bfseries ``Checkpoint'' quizzes:} These OLI quizzes cover
   material from the previous lecture and are due at 9 AM before the
   next lecture. ``Checkpoint'' quizzes are graded
   pass/fail. {\bfseries Quizzes are to be soley your own work.} (approx. 45 minutes / week )

   \2 {\bfseries Homework:} Homework assignments are due
   on Tuesdays at noon. (approx. 3 hours / week )

       \3 Homework must be handed in via BlackBoard in the specified format. Non-conforming homework will not be accepted. 

       \3 Your name, and the name of {\em everyone} who contributed to
       your solutions, must appear on your homework. 

       \3 Late homework will not be accepted.

       \3 The lowest scoring homework assignment will be dropped
       before calculating grades.
  
   \2 {\bfseries Exams:} According to Weinberg College of Arts and
   Sciences policy, every student must take the final exam at its
   scheduled time. All midterm conflicts must be resolved in advance.
       
       \3 Midterm: October 24, 2014 in class 
       \3 Final: December 10, 2014 from 3-5 PM

\1 {\bfseries Grading:}
  \2 15\% Checkpoints 
  \2 25\% Homework
  \2 30\% Midterm  
  \2 30\% Comprehensive final 

\1 {\bfseries Laptop policy:} A computer is required for the course,
but do not bring your laptops to lecture unless requested. If you
require or strongly prefer a laptop for note taking, please see me. 

\1 {\bfseries Calculator policy:} A calculator is required for
exams. Graphing calculators are not necessary. The use of phones and similar
devices is forbidden during exams. Calculators may not be shared
during exams.  

\1 {\bfseries AccessibleNU:} Any student requesting accommodations
related to a disability or other condition is required to register
with AccessibleNU (accessiblenu@northwestern.edu or 847-467-5530) and
provide professors with an accommodation notification from
AccessibleNU, preferably within the first two weeks of class. All
information will remain confidential.

\1 {\bfseries Academic Integrity:} Suspected violations of academic
integrity will be reported to the Dean's Office. For more information
on Northwesternâ€™s academic integrity policies, see
\url{http://www.weinberg.northwestern.edu/handbook/integrity/index.html}.

\section*{Stat 202 Schedule} 
Lecture A-B denotes that lecture will cover pages A-B in the
textbook. Checkpoints are due at 9 AM on the indicated day. Homework
is due at noon on the indicated day. Class sessions marked
``Instructor Review'' and ``Student Review'' are designated in-class
review sessions that are led by the instructor and students
respectively. Class sessions marked ``Special Topics'' will cover
additional topics of interest to the students as time allows. In
accordance with Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences policy, no
assignments are due during reading week and attendance at class
meetings during that week is strictly optional. \\

A detailed list of the checkpoints follows.

\subsection*{Checkpoints}
Checkpoints are numbered sequentially. Checkpoints marked ``skipped''
assess material that is not covered in the class and are not
graded. Checkpoints marked ``On BlackBoard'' are taken directly on
BlackBoard instead of via the OLI software. Checkpoints marked
``practice'' assess material covered in the course, but they are ungraded. \\
